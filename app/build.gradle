// Problem: To develop a social media analytics tool, we need a solid foundation with the necessary dependencies
// to manage and analyze data from multiple social media platforms. The build.gradle file is essential 
// for defining the application properties and dependencies that will help us achieve these functionalities.

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    // Solution: Setting up the application ID gives a unique identity to the app, essential for distribution
    // and access to the Google Play Store. This structure is fundamental for a professional application.
    compileSdkVersion 33

        applicationId "com.madhub.socialmediaanalytics"
        minSdkVersion 21 // Problem: Lower versions restrict access to modern features
        targetSdkVersion 33 // Solution: Targeting the latest SDK ensures we utilize the latest features and optimizations

// Problem: Social media analytics tools require handling networking and data processing efficiently
// Solution: Adding required dependencies to enable networking, UI development, and data processing

dependencies {
    // This dependency solves the problem of making network requests to social media APIs for data collection
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0' // Retrofit for REST API integration

    // This dependency addresses the challenge of parsing JSON data returned by social media APIs
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0' // Gson converter for Retrofit

    // This resolves the limitation of multithreading during network requests, ensuring smooth performance
    implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.9.3' // OkHttp for efficient HTTP client

    // This library provides tools for scheduling and automating tasks in the background
    implementation 'androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.7.1' // WorkManager for background tasks

    // Problem: The application must provide a smooth user interface
    // Solution: Adding dependency for UI components like RecyclerView
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.2.1' // RecyclerView for displaying lists

    // This dependency supports analytics to track user interactions and improve app performance
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics-ktx:21.0.0' // Firebase for analytics

    // This library addresses UI design problems with Material components
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.6.1' // Material Design components for better UI

    // Additional libraries can be added here as needed for enhanced functionality
}

// Problem: To ensure that the application can run on various platforms, we need to focus on the Android 
// platform capabilities, including cloud and emulator support as provided by MadHub.
